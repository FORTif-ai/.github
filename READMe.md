## Ultimate Objective
FORTif.ai is an AI-driven companion that empowers seniors to live independently by merging proactive safety monitoring with tailored daily support. Using a computer-vision‚Äìpowered Hazard Detection model, it continuously scans the home for potential risks‚Äîlike spills, cluttered pathways, and tripping hazards‚Äîand offers clear, actionable recommendations to address them. At the same time, an intuitive AI chatbot engages users in friendly, proactive conversations, providing timely medication and appointment reminders, personalized wellness check-ins, and empathetic responses to questions or concerns. With built-in voice-to-text capabilities and real-time safety insights, FORTif.ai delivers a seamless, user-centric experience designed to enhance home safety, streamline everyday routines, and foster lasting independence for seniors.

## Project Goals

1. **AI Chatbot (LLM)**: Design and deploy a robust conversational assistant
   - Develop reliable voice-to-text transcription with built-in quality control
   - Implement an action-oriented interface for booking appointments and sending medication reminders
   - Ensure LLM responses are accurate, relevant, and aligned with senior-friendly language
   - Integrate the chatbot with the back-end Hazard Detection system for contextual alerts
   - ***AI Topics:*** *Speech Recognition, Prompt Engineering, LLM Evaluation, System Integration*

2. **Hazard Detection (OpenCV)**: Build and validate a vision-based model for home-hazard identification
   - **Subgoal 1:** Model development to detect obstacles along predefined walkways
   - **Subgoal 2:** Define performance metrics and risk thresholds (e.g., model accuracy and obstacle risk scoring)
   - **Subgoal 3:** Curate and preprocess high-quality training datasets (data cleansing, augmentation, transformation)
   - Quantify obstacle count and relative size for risk prioritization
   - Establish a 70:30 training-testing data split to evaluate generalization
   - ***AI Topics:*** *Computer Vision, Object Detection, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation*

3. **Integration**: Deliver a seamless, end-to-end user experience
   - Push real-time hazard alerts and recommendations through the AI chatbot
   - Conduct end-to-end testing of voice, vision, and notification pipelines
   - Validate system performance in simulated home environments and user trials
   - ***AI Topics:*** *Multimodal integration, API Development, UX Design, Automated Testing*

## Background
As the global population ages, many seniors face significant challenges in maintaining their independence while ensuring their safety. Common risks include falls, accidents at home due to environmental hazards, and difficulties in managing daily tasks, such as taking medications or attending appointments. These issues often lead to a decline in quality of life and can result in a need for constant caregiver assistance, which is not always feasible or sustainable.

The goal of this project is to address these challenges by providing seniors with an AI-driven assistant that promotes both safety and independence. By using computer vision for hazard detection, gait analysis for fall vulnerability assessment, and a user-friendly chatbot for daily reminders and check-ins, we hope to ensure that seniors can confidently navigate their living spaces while staying on top of their personal care routines. This project aims to reduce the risk of accidents, improve daily living, and empower seniors to maintain their autonomy in a safe, supportive environment.
