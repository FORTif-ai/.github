# Ultimate Objective
FORTif.ai is an AI-driven companion that empowers seniors to live independently by merging proactive safety monitoring with tailored daily support. Using a computer-vision–powered Hazard Detection model, it continuously scans the home for potential risks—like spills, cluttered pathways, and tripping hazards—and offers clear, actionable recommendations to address them. At the same time, an intuitive AI chatbot engages users in friendly, proactive conversations, providing timely medication and appointment reminders, personalized wellness check-ins, and empathetic responses to questions or concerns. With built-in voice-to-text capabilities and real-time safety insights, FORTif.ai delivers a seamless, user-centric experience designed to enhance home safety, streamline everyday routines, and foster lasting independence for seniors.

# Project Goals

# Background
As the global population ages, many seniors face significant challenges in maintaining their independence while ensuring their safety. Common risks include falls, accidents at home due to environmental hazards, and difficulties in managing daily tasks, such as taking medications or attending appointments. These issues often lead to a decline in quality of life and can result in a need for constant caregiver assistance, which is not always feasible or sustainable.

The goal of this project is to address these challenges by providing seniors with an AI-driven assistant that promotes both safety and independence. By using computer vision for hazard detection, gait analysis for fall vulnerability assessment, and a user-friendly chatbot for daily reminders and check-ins, we hope to ensure that seniors can confidently navigate their living spaces while staying on top of their personal care routines. This project aims to reduce the risk of accidents, improve daily living, and empower seniors to maintain their autonomy in a safe, supportive environment.
